# Y-Be Website Development Instructions for AI Assistants

## Project Overview
This project is developing a premium website for Y-Be, a data-driven web solutions company. The website must position Y-Be as a strategic partner that engineers competitive advantages, not just another web agency.

## Brand Identity & Design System

### Color Palette (STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED)
- **Primary Navy Blue**: #2D3A4E (dominant color for authority and expertise)
- **Light Beige**: #D9BBA4 (warm accent for approachability and CTAs)
- **Pure White**: #FFFFFF (clean contrast for readability)

### Color Usage Guidelines
- **Navy Blue**: Primary backgrounds, headers, navigation, body text
- **Beige**: CTA buttons, accent sections, interactive highlights, card backgrounds
- **White**: Content backgrounds, text on dark sections, breathing space
- **Never use**: Generic blues, greens, or other colors not in the official palette

### Typography System
- **Headings**: Truetypewriter or Metamorphous (bold, distinctive serif for impact)
- **Body Text**: Inter, Roboto, or clean modern sans-serif
- **Hierarchy**: Clear progression from h1 (largest impact) to body text
- **Avoid**: Generic system fonts, Comic Sans, overly decorative fonts

### Visual Design Principles
- **Organic Curves**: Use soft, curved shapes throughout (border-radius, section dividers)
- **Generous Whitespace**: Premium positioning requires breathing room
- **Asymmetrical Balance**: Dynamic layouts, avoid rigid grid systems
- **Subtle Shadows**: Depth without heaviness (use Tailwind shadow utilities)

## Content Strategy & Messaging

### Brand Voice
- **Professional yet Approachable**: Technical expertise without intimidation
- **Data-Driven**: Always emphasize metrics, results, analysis
- **Strategic Focus**: Position services as competitive advantages, not just websites
- **Premium Positioning**: Language that justifies higher pricing

### Key Messaging Principles
- Never say "we build websites" → say "we engineer competitive advantages"
- Always include specific metrics when possible ("+48% traffic", "2.3x conversions")
- Focus on business outcomes, not technical features
- Emphasize strategic analysis and data-driven decisions

### Content Tone Guidelines
- **Headlines**: Bold, impactful, benefit-focused
- **Body Copy**: Clear, professional, benefit-driven
- **CTAs**: Action-oriented, value-focused ("Claim Your Analysis" not "Contact Us")
- **Testimonials**: Focus on business results, not satisfaction

## Technical Development Standards

### Component Architecture
- **Reusable Components**: Build once, use everywhere (buttons, cards, sections)
- **Design System**: All components must use design tokens
- **Consistent Styling**: Never hardcode colors or spacing
- **Mobile-First**: Always design for mobile, then scale up

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all components
- **Clean Code**: Meaningful variable names, clear component structure
- **Performance**: Optimize images, lazy load content, minimize bundle size
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance, proper ARIA labels

### Tailwind CSS Usage
- **Custom Config**: Use design tokens for colors, spacing, typography
- **Utility Classes**: Prefer utilities over custom CSS
- **Responsive Design**: Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes consistently
- **Component Classes**: Create component classes for complex repeated patterns

## User Experience Guidelines

### Navigation & Flow
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Easy to understand site structure
- **Strategic CTAs**: Guide users toward consultation booking
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animations that enhance, don't distract
- **Mobile Experience**: Touch-friendly, fast-loading, intuitive

### Conversion Optimization
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal information strategically
- **Social Proof**: Include metrics and testimonials prominently
- **Trust Signals**: Certifications, security badges, professional imagery
- **Urgency Elements**: Limited availability, exclusive offers (when appropriate)

### Form Design
- **Strategic Questions**: Forms that educate while collecting data
- **UX Focused**: Minimal friction, clear labels, helpful validation
- **Value Exchange**: Always communicate what user gets in return
- **Mobile Optimized**: Easy to complete on any device
