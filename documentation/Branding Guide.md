# Y-Be Design System & Visual Identity

## Color Palette Strategy

### Primary Colors

- **Dark Navy Blue (#2D3A4E):** The dominant color establishing trust, professionalism, and stability. Used for primary backgrounds, headers, and key UI elements to convey authority and expertise in data-driven solutions.
- **Light Beige (#D9BBA4):** A warm, approachable accent color that softens the corporate navy while maintaining sophistication. Creates visual hierarchy and draws attention to key interactive elements.
- **Pure White (#FFFFFF):** Clean contrast color for text readability, content backgrounds, and breathing space that prevents the design from feeling heavy or overwhelming.

### Color Psychology & Business Alignment

The navy-beige-white palette strategically positions Y-Be as both trustworthy and innovative. Navy conveys the analytical rigor and professional competence clients expect from data-driven consultants, while beige adds warmth and approachability that differentiates from sterile corporate competitors. This combination suggests premium quality without intimidation.

## Typography Hierarchy
